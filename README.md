### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. If you want to utilize a variable you must first declare it using the keyword "var" so that the program recognizes it as a true variable.
2. If you want to calculate the values of inputs, you must first convert the variable's value from a string into an integer, or float (depending on what you are trying to do) using the parseFloat () or parseInt () methods.
3. When Javascript encounters an error, it declines to move forward in the execution of its code.
